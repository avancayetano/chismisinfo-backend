# chismisinfo-backend

The backend logic for the CS 132 project of Chismisinformation Team, for public viewing. Contains all the data science logic, as well as the web scraping codes.

This repo does not contain the tweet data that we used for privacy reasons. If you are interested in obtaining the data, send us a message by filling out the form on the chismisinformation website (in the About page) (https://avancayetano.github.io/cs132-project/about/).

Note that this repo may not reflect our most updated backend code since our development version is kept private.

However, we'll try to keep this repo updated as much as possible.
